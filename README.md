<div style="text-align: right;">

#### Mar 2021 – present | Chilliwack, BC

</div>
</div>

- Accustomed to a demanding, highly dynamic work environment from on-site role with construction contractor
- Programmatically generated large, detailed site drawings, using self-developed method of AutoCAD automation, saving thousands of man-hours and reducing likelihood of errors
- Pioneered aerial survey program; creating online database of 2D and 3D models using photogrammetry for use in construction planning, drawings, estimating and progress tracking
- Created advanced, map-based visualizations of dynamic project information allowing for all stakeholders to clearly understand performance metrics and project specifications
- Performed complicated analyses of geospatial, project controls, and natural resource data to inform key decisions

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

#### **Junior Pipeline Project,** _Engineer SA Energy Group_

<div style="text-align: right;">

#### Sep 2016 – Mar 2021 | Western Canada

</div>
</div>

- On-site contract role on large-scale construction projects in Northern BC, Edmonton and Saskatchewan Exceptionally strong skills in modelling and visualization, honed through experience incorporating field survey data into engineering drawings such as pipeline profiles, site layouts, grade execution plans
- Worked indepedently and under tight deadlines to perform field survey using RTK GPS and survey drones Also worked in Calgary office where exposed to all stages of project estimating; including crew planning, subcontractor relations and resource allocation

## **PROJECTS**

#### **AutoCAD Automation Library,** _Python, Object-Oriented Programming, Custom Library_

- Python library for generating AutoCAD scripts to allow for drawing automation
- Created out of frustration at first engineering job when populating large drawings by hand
- Reduced time to complete a large site drawing by 95% (three months > three days) with far fewer errors

#### **Pipeline Information Webapp,** _(in progress), Flask, React, SVG, ReactJS, Express, LeafletJS_

- Single-page application for viewing details about linear construction projects in multiple formats (profile, map, tabular) to be a single source of information and inform field decisions

#### **Personal Photography Website,** _Node.js, Google Cloud Platform, Static-Site Generation_

- Site to showcase photography portfolio and learn about deploying on Google Cloud Platform
- Pages are algorithmically generated upon server start to mirror the file system structure allowing for very quick editing of albums and photos displayed
- Creating and hosting this site from scratch saves hundreds of dollars per year on Squarespace

#### **Chainage Photo Renamer,** _Python, GUI, TKinter, Spatial Optimization_

- Windows app renames photos taken in the vicinity of a linear construction project with the project chainage (distance in meters from the start of the project to location) of the photos' geolocation
- Used by workers on two, billion-dollar projects to organize tens of thousands of jobsite images

#### **Weather Station Constellation & Reporting,** _Python, Cronjob, Third-Party API, Email Automation, Linux_

- Private constellation of weather stations along remote construction project in northern BC with Raspberry Pi collecting data and sending daily summary report to project management to inform their decisions for the day
- Multi-million-dollar contract changes approved due to adverse weather conditions captured by system
